First C#/Xamarian project for college
Create Yahtzee.

Create a game of Yahtzee using the Xamarin Forms. If you are not familiar with the rules of Yahtzee,
then you can find full details here at Wikipedia - Yahtzee.
You will need to achieve the following:
1. Create a Ul with the following elements
• Title Banner for the game
• Correct board with fields to complete as per standard rules
• Five dice with a roll button for the user
• A way for the user to mark the current roll
• The program must assess the current dice value and the user's choice to see what score should
be given for it
• Button(s) that the user taps to start a new game
2. Create a random number generator that is used for the dice roll
3. Create a method to assess the value of the dice and the user's choice to assign a score
4. Update the screen and prevent the user from selecting the same category twice
5. Correctly reset the board to start a new game, but ask the user if they are sure of this action when
a game is in progress
Coding Elements:
1. Create the Mark Up for a basic UI consisting of StackLayouts, Grids, Labels, Radio Buttons,
Checkboxes, Entry boxes and Buttons(as appropriate).
2. Keep in mind that the purpose should be obvious to the user or you can show some instructions.
3. Create a number of methods in C# to generate random numbers, compare numbers and update UI
elements during runtime. This is a mix of methods and Event Handlers (special purpose methods).
4. Thinking about testing - user input and validation are important so consider how to make the user
experience an enjoyable one.
